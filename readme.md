Question 1: Ruby Hashes
Implement a Ruby like Hash in Javascript. You will be able to use Object as a base to get most of the behaviour.

Name the class Hash.
Its constructor will take an object as argument.
It should add support for the following ruby Hash methods as prototype methods:
.empty (name it .isEmpty in Javascript)
.merge (merges both hashes into a new hash and returns it)
.hasKey (checks if key is in hash)
.invert (returns a new Hash with keys & their values and vice versa)
.inspect(display the hash ruby style as a string)
.keys (returns all hash keys in an array)
.values (returns all hash values in an array)
All methods that return a hash must return a new Hash object.
Don't overthink this. Javascript Objects and Ruby Hashes are similar.

Example usage:

let emptyHash = new Hash({});
let hash = new Hash({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3});

hash.isEmpty() // returns false
emptyHash.isEmpty() // returns true

let merged = hash.merge(new Hash({bob: 'yo', jane: 'ya'}));
// returns Hash {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, bob: 'yo', jane: 'ya'}
// should not mutate original hash

merged !== hash // should be true

hash.hasKey('a') // returns true
hash.hasKey('bob') // returns false
merged.hasKey('bob') // returns true

// Values will have to made into strings
hash.invert() // returns Hash {'1':'a', '2':'b', '3':'c'}

hash.inspect() // returns "{'a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3}"

hash.keys() // returns ['a', 'b', 'c']
hash.values() // returns [1, 2, 3]


Question 2: Stacks & Queues

Implement a Stack and a Queue data structure in Javascript.

Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.
Write a Javascript constructor called Stack and another Javascript class called Queue.
Each should have a prototype method, add, that adds an element to the stack or queue and returns it.
Each should have a prototype method, remove, that removes an element from the stack or queue and returns it.
Make sure that each constructor/class behaves properly as per definitions of stacks and queues.


Question 3: Digit Product Sequence

A digit product sequence is a type of sequence where the next number in the sequence is calculated by adding the product of each digit of the number and the number.

For example:

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 22, 26, 38, 62
The above are the first 9 numbers of the sequence.

Write a function, digitProduct, that takes a number, n, as an argument and calculates the nth number in the sequence.

digitProduct(3) // returns 4
digitProduct(6) // returns 22
digitProduct(9) // returns 62
